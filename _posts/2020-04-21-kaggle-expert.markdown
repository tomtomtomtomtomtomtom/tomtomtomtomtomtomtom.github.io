Hello!

I've been working on `kaggle` for a couple of days, especially on the `Santander Customer Transaction Prediction` competition.
The competition was pretty challenging, because the features were anonymized and had almost no correlation to each other.


In addition, some of the data in the test set were not used for scoring and were fake data that were made by Santander.
But this [`this kernel`](https://www.kaggle.com/yag320/list-of-fake-samples-and-public-private-lb-split) was absolutely amazing. I think we need to give a hands clap to the kernel author. He just found out how to split the fake data with the real data in the test dataset. Not to say that he found which data was used for public, and private scoring.


Anyways, what a competition!! 
I ranked `445th` out of 8802 teams in this competition(`Top 6%`), and recieved my second `bronze medal`. (3 places to silver medal...orz). My second bronze medal means my position as a `kaggle expert`. 


I'll continue working on data science and kaggle. 
Hope I can become a kaggle Master soon.
